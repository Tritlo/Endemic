Module      : Synth.Gen2
Description : Holds the (revamped) Genetic Algorithm Parts of HenProg
License     : MIT
Stability   : experimental
Portability : POSIX

This module holds the (reworked) genetic Algorithm parts of the HenProg Library.
The algorithms are more advanced and sophisticated than the initial implementation.

The primary building brick is an EFix (See "Synth.Types") that resembles a set of
changes done to the Code. The goodness of a certain fix is expressed by the
failing and succeeding properties, which are a list of boolean values (true for passing properties, false for failing).

The methods often require a StdGen for the random parts. A StdGen is, for non-haskellers, a random number provider.
It is expressed in Haskell as an infinite list of next-random-values.
We expect that the StdGen is generated e.g. in the Main Method from a Seed and passed here.
See: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/random-1.2.0/docs/System-Random.html

**Prefixes**

- tX is an X related to Tournament Behaviour (e.g. tSize = TournamentSize)
- iX is an X related to Island Behaviour (e.g. iConf = IslandConfiguration)

**Genetic - Naming**
A Chromosome is made up by Genotypes, which are the building bricks of changes/diffs.
In our Context, a Genotype is a single diff we apply to the Code resembled by an EFix, and the Chromosome is a [EFix].
A Phenotype is the "physical implementation" of a Chromosome, in our context that is the program with all the patches applied.
That is, our [EFix] turns from a Genotype to a Phenotype once it is run against the properties.
The final representation of Solutions provided by "Synth.Diff" is also a (different) Phenotype.

**Island Evolution**
We also introduce a parallelized genetic algorithm called "Island Evolution".
In concept, there are n Island with a separate population. Every x generations, a few
species migrate from one Island to another.
This should help to "breed" one partial-solution per Island, with the migration helping to bring partial solutions together.
This is particularly interesting, as maybe fixes for a program need to originate from two places or multiple changes.
In the described paper, the species migrate ring-wise and the best species are being copied,
while the worst on the receiving island are simply discarded in favor of the best from the sending island.

**Open Questions // Points**

    - Do we want to have unique elements in populations? Do we want this as a flag?
    - We could move caching into the fitness function, if we e.g. add a "hidden" reader monad to it.
      As long as the fitness here is pure that's fine and might make some tasks much nicer
      if we can easily re-calculate fitness instead of carrying it around.
      We could re-implement it similar to StdGen which also has a hidden state within the Monad.
    - Timeouts are not actually interrupting - the are checked after a generation.
      That can lead to a heavy plus above the specified timeout, e.g. by big populations on Islands.

This is the primary method of this module.
It runs a genetic search that terminates in three cases:
    a) x iterations done
    b) n minutes passed
    c) solutions found (optionally with early exit)
It will return an empty List in case of no found solutions.

It also optionally runs Island Evolution depending on the Configuration. See module comment on more information.
